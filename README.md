# Why hypercore

As we are exploring the design for running Tradle on Hypercore, this summarizes our findings.

## What is hypercore

If you do not find answers to your questions below. See an [extensive FAQ](FAQ.md) for more.

### Monopolies are not good

Web's Hub and spoke technical architecture is the reason we have now the monopolies with billions of users, the size of which we never seen before.
